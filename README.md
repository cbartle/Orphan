# Orphan
A game by Collin Bartley and Joe Soriano using Unity


A 2D platformer.

Setting:
  Industrial Revolution
  England

Story:
  A young boy at an orphanage.
  Orphanage caretakers run a factory and use the orphans as free labor.  Character (for now we chall call him Bucky), finds letter from mother after being at the orphanage and working for the care takers for a couple years.  After reading the letter that explains his mother will wait for him in the forest, Bucky decides to go out in search of her.  The caretakers are not happy about this and chase after him through the factory (the first setting for the game). Throught the factory, Bucky finds unfinished tonics which the caretakers use to keep the children in line.  To his surprise, Bucky realizes that the unfinished tonics invert the world he is in.  
  
  Once Bucky gets through the factory, escaping through a chimney in which the main caretaker (a large woman) gets stuck in, he finds his way into the sewer system to avoid hinderance from people.  Makes his way through the puzzles the sewer has to offer with little help from the tonics.  The challenges are harder, but that does not stop him in his search for his mother.
  
  After finding a way out of the sewer, Bucky makes his way to the forest.  At the edge of the forest, he finds a baby bird on the ground.  Helping it learn to fly, they become best friends.  As Bucky travels deeper into the forest to find the spot his mother's letter talked about, he uses his bird to help lower branches and grab vines to get across large revines.  Using the tonics that underaged people left in the woods, Bucky makes his way through the forest.  Upon entering the middle, Bucky notices a clearing with a gravestone.  Looking back at the letter, the clearing is the spot his mother mentioned.  Running to the gravestone, Bucky is fearful of what he might find.  Looking carefully, he reads "Here lies (name of Bucky's mother).  Beloved wife and  mother."
  
  The game ends with the Title on a black screen.
